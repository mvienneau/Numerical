You may notice that there are two versions of givens_main and given_rot.

givens_main2 and givens_rot2 are implemented as you wanted it, where each rotation elimintaes all zeros at once. The test run on this implemntation as well. I decided to keep the other in the code mainly for my self so I could compare and contrast the two different methods of implementation.


To Run: 
python3 givens.py
