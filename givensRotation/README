givens_main2 and givens_rot2 are implemented where each rotation elimintaes all zeros at once. The test run on this implemntation 
as well. I decided to keep the other in the code mainly for my self so I could compare and contrast 
the two different methods of implementating the givens rotation


To Run: 
python3 givens.py
